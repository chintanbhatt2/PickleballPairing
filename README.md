# Pickleball Pairings

https://pickleball-pairings.web.app/

Every month I'm a part of a round-robin style pickleball tournament and one of the issues we've faced is a compenent way of making a random, but fair, tournament. The best method was just to make sure everyone was only partnered one and to assign teams at random.

This website hopes to take care of that issue by ensuring that matches are played against new opponents and are picked so that they are fair based of previous matches.

## Frontend
The front end is a react application using Redux for state management.

## Backend
In the backend I'm using a NodeJS Espress server to facilitate the match making logic as well as connecting to the database

## Database
I'm using MongoDB as my database
